          <h2>Overview: The Denizen Designer Project </h2>

          <p>
            Participatory Design is positioned to be a democratized approach to
            design which centers and amplifies community voices that may
            otherwise be neglected. Researchers, scholars, and practitioners
            alike have begun to look to this approach as a way to solve societal
            problems alongside the communities that are impacted. The Denizen
            Designer Project is an ethnographic exploration of best practices
            and use cases of participatory design as a methodological framework.
            This project featured individuals who leverage design as a practice
            or framework to work towards change in marginalized communities.
            Using ethnographic interviews, we collected over 100 accounts of
            local community members who are engaging in participatory design
            work. The Denizen Designer Project highlighted this design work in
            local communities and identified perspectives on designâ€™s access and
            reach for those outside of academia.{' '}
